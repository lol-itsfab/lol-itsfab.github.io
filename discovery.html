    <h1>Individual Discovery Project</h1>

    <h> The main idea...</h>
    <p>
      
      For this project, the main objective is to utilize a Raspberry pi 5 and attach a camera while having a pre-trained dataset, so the pi would know what it is trying to detect
      while giving an identification guess and also giving a certain confidence value related to the guess.
    </p>

    <p>
      I used the following tools and technologies:
        <li> Raspberry Pi 5</li>
        <li> Camera attachment</li>
        <li> Wide camera lens</li>
    </p>

    <div class="image-row">
    <img src="images/parts.jpg" alt="parts" class="half-img">
    <img src="images/pi_photo.jpg" alt="pi photo" class="half-img">
    </div>
    <p><em>Here are some of the pictures that ressemble the project.</em></p>

    <p>
      The result was a working prototype that recognized objects using the camera that was hooked up to the Raspberry Pi 5. Although it did work it, there was some obstacles.
    </p>
      <h>
        The Process...
      </h>
    <div class="image-row">
    <img src="images/code.jpeg" alt="Code" class="half-img">
    <img src="images/Downlaods.jpeg" alt="Downlaods" class="half-img">
    </div>

    <p>
      
      Here are two pictures that describe what I had to do... I had to first download multiple softwares that would allow the Pi to work and allow "Computer Vision."
      The First photo shows the code that was made so the Pi could access the camera with the models that were being used.
    </p>

    <h>
      Some ECE skills gained!
    </h>

    <p>
      Some ECE skills that I gained through this project was the ability to work with emebedded systems. This was my first project with a Raspberry Pi 5, in fact a Raspberry Pi.
      I always hear that these devices are mini computers that have great capabilities if used correctly. They are mini computers that can fit in the palm of your hand which is insane.
      I also learned how to integrate many parts of hardware and allow them to work together, as well as integate software to the mix.
    </p>

    <h>
      Some problems...
    </h>

    <p>
      I had problems in which sometimes it would not outline an object nor give a guess as to what the object was. Here are some examples...
    </p>

    <div class="image-row">
    <img src="images/cup1.jpeg" alt="cup1" class="half-img">
    <img src="images/cup2.jpeg" alt="cup2" class="half-img">
    </div>

    <p>
      Lastly, although it did not work that often this was a great learning experience for myself and sparked an interest in embedded systems for myself. I hope to imporve in this
      area and I see myself doing more projects like this in the future.
