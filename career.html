    <h1>My Career Goals</h1>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to become a VLSI or ASIC Engineer for a top tech company. I'm passionate about Hardware and Software integration,
      and my current academic and project work is focused on building the foundation to achieve this. For instance, my threads allow me to explore
      VLSI, ASIC's, and FPGA's.
    </p>

    <p>
      Based on my ECE roadmap, my short-term goals are:
        <li>Complete relevant coursework in digital design, system-on-chip, and embedded systems</li>
        <li>Gain internship experience in hardware development or systems engineering</li>
        <li>Strengthen my skills in C, Verilog, and digital layout tools</li>
    </p>
