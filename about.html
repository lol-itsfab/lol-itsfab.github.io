    <p>
        Last semester I was in a VIP research group Titled VIP: Intelligent Digitial Communications. Within this research group we broke into smaller groups
        where I was in the FPGA/ DSP team. Within this team we researched ways that nodes can commnicate with each other given a distance. This allowed us to
        upload Verilog code to an FPGA to test is out as a prototype.
